# Titanic Survival Prediction 

Predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using multiple machine learning classifiers.

##  Overview
This project loads the Titanic dataset, preprocesses it, trains four classifiers, and compares their performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.

##  Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

##  Dataset
Using `seaborn`'s built-in Titanic dataset.

##  How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python titanic_classifier.py
